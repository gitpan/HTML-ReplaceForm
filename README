NAME
    HTML::ReplaceForm - easily replace HTML form fields with corresponding
    values

SYNOPSIS
      use HTML::ReplaceForm;
     $modified_html = replace_form($html,$data_href);

DESCRIPTION
    This is useful for creating an HTML email message from a web form, while
    sharing a single template that is used for both purposes.

    Keep the form in an include file that is used both on the web and in an
    email template.

    The real, regular HTML in the form will automatically have the form
    fields replaced with corresponding values by the "replace_form()"
    function, which you can then use to send the HTML email.

FUNCTIONS
  replace_form
     $modified_html = replace_form($html,$data_href);

    Replace form elements with with a hashref of corresponding data.

    Note: For now, replace radio and checkboxes with an X if they are
    marked. They are troublesome because there are multiple inputs with the
    same name, and they have labels next to them.

    Args:

     $html       - Any kind of HTML data structure that HTML::TokeParser::Simple accepts 
     $data_href  a hashref of data that corresponds to the form

  TODO
    There are small bits of HTML design which are currently embedded in
    here. The user should have control over these.

     - $data is displayed as <strong>$data</strong>
     - A selected checkbox or radio button is displayed as [<strong>X</strong>]
     - An unselected checkbox or radio button is displayed as  [ ]
